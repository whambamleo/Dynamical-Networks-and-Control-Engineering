%% State space and Lsim
% State space assumes equations of the form x(k) = Ax(k-1) + Bu, y(k) =
% Cx(k-1) + Du. x values are the values of the system state, and y values
% are the outputs. In this case, we can just output the entire state and
% none of the output, i.e., y(k) = x(k-1) + 0u. Thus C is the identity and
% D is a vector of 0s.

A = [0.95 0.04 0 0; 0.05 0.85 0 0; 0 0.1 1 0; 0 0.01 0 1]; % You can also set this using variables like in the last section
B = zeros(4,1); % There's no input, so our B matrix can just be a vector of zeros
C = eye(4);
D = zeros(4,1);
x0 = [1; 0; 0; 0];

sir = ss(A,B,C,D,1); % Setting the last argument to 1 indicates a discrete time system

tspan = 0:999; % Time from day 0 to day 999, i.e., 1000 days
u = zeros(1000,1); % u is the input. We have no input, so we can set it to 0 for each time point

y = lsim(sir,u,tspan,x0); % lsim takes in the state space representation of the system, the input (zeros in our case), the time vector, and the initial condition
